# Todo App Exercise

<p>This is a repository for a simple todo app.</p>

<p>The todo app is created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

<p>I've tried to make the design look modern and simple. Also, wanted to incorporate a chaos - order relationship in the UI, that's my main feeling behind a todo app - to bring order in a chaotic and fast-paced day.</p>

<p>The main idea of the exercise was to practice JavaScript & CSS. 
Had several stumbling stones for this exercise but most of them were because of overthinking and overcomplicating how to do certain things. After taking a step back and implementing a simpler approach things fell into place pretty fast and easily.</p>
